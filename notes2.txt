STARTING A FASTAPI APP
Run the command
    uvicorn main:app --reload

The command uvicorn main:app refers to:
    main - the file main.py (the Python "module").
    app - the object created inside of main.py with the line app = FastAPI().
    --reload - make the server restart after code changes. Only use for development.

To use uvicorn to run a nested FastAPI instance, you use dots to reference it/
E.g:
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload (we used dot notation to access the nested file main.py)


SIMPLEST FastAPI APP

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}


Path operations (CRUD)
Use the decorator @app.operation_name ('app' is the name of your FastAPI instance)
E.g
@app.post
@app.get
@app.put
@app.delete

Path operations are evaluated in the order in which they were specified in the code.

@app.get("/profile/{user_name}")
def get_profile(user_name: str):
    return {
        "user": user_name
    }

@app.get('/profile/me')
def get_current_profile():
    return {
        "user": "current user"
    }

The second path operation for /profile/me will never be evaluated even if the get request is /profile/me. This is because the
path coincides with the first one which will always be evaluated in place of the second. To fix this, put the second one first.



*** PATH PARAMETERS AND QUERY PARAMETERS ***
** PATH PARAMETERS **

This is the part of the resource string that comes after the host name but before the '?', after which there are query parameters.
e.g
foo.com/bar/chaz/lar/8?fname=john&lname=doe
/bar/chaz/lar are path parameters
fname and lname are query parameters

Defining path parameters
@app.get("/profile/{uid}") # put the path name in brackets and access it using the same name in your function
def get_profile(uid: int): # providing type hints is useful for parsing and validation
    return {
        "user": uid
}

Path parameters must be provided in the query, even if they are null (None). This is because the URL has to match
the pattern that was defined. If the path parameter is not passed in, the URL could possibly match another schema and
confusion can arise.
A path parameter is always required as it has to be part of the path.
Query parameters don't have to be passed into the URL.


RESTRICTING A PATH PARAMETER TO PREDEFINED VALUES: Use Enum
E.g
class Gender(str, Enum): # multiple-inherit from both str and Enum. inheriting from str ensures that the query will be
    MALE = 'male'        # parsed and displayed correctly in responses back to the client
    FEMALE = 'female'
    NA = None

@quickie.get("/pets/gender/{gender}")
async def get_by_gender(gender: Union[Gender, None] = None):

    pets_by_gender = (pet for pet in pets if pet.gender == gender)
    return {
        f"{gender}_pets": pets_by_gender  # without inheriting from str, the response will be e.g Gender.MALE_pets instead of male_pets
    }


Path Parameters Containing Paths

@app.get("/files/{file_path:path}")
async def read_file(file_path: str):
    return {"file_path": file_path}

In this case, the name of the parameter is file_path, and the last part, :path, tells it that the parameter should match any path.
    e.g "/path/to/resource"



** QUERY PARAMETERS **
When you declare other function parameters that are not part of the path parameters, they are AUTOMATICALLY INTERPRETED as "query" parameters.
E.g:

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: str, q: str | None = None):
    if q:
        return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
    return {"item_id": item_id}
FastAPI is smart enough to notice that the path parameter item_id is a path parameter and q is not, so, it's a query parameter.

You can declare multiple path parameters and query parameters at the same time, FastAPI knows which is which. And you don't have to
declare them in any specific order. They will be detected by name.

Have in mind that the most important part to make a parameter optional is the part:
    = None
or the:
    = Query(default=None)
as it will use that None as the default value, and that way make the parameter not required.

The rest is just type hints, but it is not what tells FastAPI that this parameter is not required. Having a default value of any type,
including None, makes the parameter optional (not required) because if it is not supplied, the default value will be used instead.
When you're writing code with type hints, assume it doesn't have type hints and see if the way you wrote it would actually work.
Type hints are just annotations, they don't have much effect on execution.

To make a parameter required, you can:
    - simply just not provide a default value
    - use ellipsis (...). It is used by Pydantic and FastAPI to EXPLICITLY declare that a value is required
      E.g def filter_profile(user_name: Annotated[str, Query(min_length=4)] = ...)
    - Use Required from pydantic.
        from pydantic import Required
        def filter_profile(user_name: Annotated[str, Query(min_length=4)] = Required)



REQUEST BODY
When you need to send data from a client to your API, you send it as a request body. Clients don't need to send request bodies all the time.
Use Pydantic models to declare a request body.

To send data, you should use one of: POST (the more common), PUT, DELETE or PATCH.
Sending a body with a GET request is discouraged. Proxies in the middle might not support it.

Inherit from pydantic's BaseModel

from pydantic import BaseModel

class Pet(BaseModel):
    animal: str
    name: str
    gender: Union[Gender, None] = None

You can declare path, request and body parameters all at the same time.
FastAPI will recognize the parameters in the function correctly as follows:
    - If the parameter is also declared in the path, it will be used as a path parameter.
    - If the parameter is of a singular type (like int, float, str, bool, etc) it will be interpreted as a query parameter (not defined in path).
    - If the parameter is declared to be of the type of a Pydantic model, it will be interpreted as a request body.

How to provide default value for the fields of a pydantic model from value returned from a function
class Recruit(BaseModel):
    name: str
    total_comp: int = 0
    start_date: datetime | None = datetime.now()
If you do the above, the 'start_date' will be the same for all instances of Recruit. datetime.now() is only called once when the first instance
is instantiated, and then that value is used across all instances. This is because setting:
    start_date = datetime.now() # let's ignore the annotation
makes start_date a class variable and not an instance variable.

To mitigate this, Pydantic comes in handy.
    from pydantic import Field
    class Recruit(BaseModel):
        name: str
        total_comp: int = 0
        start_date: datetime | None = Field(default_factory=datetime.now)

    Use the 'Field' property from pydantic and supply to it the function that you want it to call through the 'default_factory' parameter
    (without the parentheses of course). When the pydantic model is instantiated, the default value of star_date will be the correct current
    date and time.



*** QUERY PARAMETERS AND STRING VALIDATIONS ***
Annotated comes in handy (*remember?*)

Side note: Advantages of Annotated
        Using Annotated is recommended instead of the default value in function parameters, it is better for multiple reasons. ðŸ¤“

        The default value of the function parameter is the actual default value, that's more intuitive with Python in general. ðŸ˜Œ

        You could call that same function in other places without FastAPI, and it would work as expected. If there's a required
        parameter (without a default value), your editor will let you know with an error, Python will also complain if you run
        it without passing the required parameter.

        When you don't use Annotated and instead use the (old) default value style, if you call that function without FastAPI
        in other place, you have to remember to pass the arguments to the function for it to work correctly, otherwise the values
        will be different from what you expect (e.g. QueryInfo or something similar instead of str). And your editor won't complain,
        and Python won't complain running that function, only when the operations inside error out.


Because Annotated can have more than one metadata annotation, you could now even use the same function with other tools, like
We use Annotated (from typing) and Query (from fastapi). Query, meaning we're working with query parameters (coming after ?)
Annotated is used for providing metadata to our fastapi schemas, for uses such as extra data validation like this scenario where
we're adding extra validations for input data.

from typing import Annotated
from fastapi import Query

@app.get("/profile/filter/by")
def filter_profile(
        user_name: Annotated[str | None, Query(min_length=5)] = None, # the first parameter of Annotated is the type hint(s) of the argument
        age: Annotated[int | None, Query(gt=0, lt=100)] = None):      # the other parameters are metadata
    return {
        "matches": [
            {
                "user_name": user_name,
                "age": age
            }
        ]
    }

In the arguments of the Query (that we add to the Annotated as a parameter), we specify in the validations or specifications of how we want our Query
parameter to look like, and other additional info.
Notice that the default value is still None, so the parameter is still optional.

But now, having Query(min_length=5) inside of Annotated, we are telling FastAPI that we want it to extract this value from the query parameters
(this would have been the default anyway ðŸ¤·) and that we want to have additional validation for this value (that's why we do this,
TO GET THE ADDITIONAL VALIDATION ;).
By specifying Annotated[int | None, Query(gt=0, lt=100)], we want our data value to be an integer that is greater than 0 and less than 100.
FastAPI will do these validations and return errors if data values that don't meet the requirements are received.

We can put in as many validations as we want inside the Query as arguments.


QUERY PARAMETER LIST
We want to get a list as one of our query parameters. Use Annotated, with list as type hint, and Query. Don't use vanilla list without using Query,
because FastAPI will interpret it as a request body (which will not work well if it is a GET request for example), and probably your code won't work as
expected because you were expecting a query parameter and instead you're dealing with a request body.

@quickie.get("/multiple/pets")
# async def get_multiple_by_name(arg: list[str] | None = None): # don't to this
async def get_multiple_by_name(arg: Annotated[list[str] | None, Query()] = None): # do this. you can provide a default list apart from None
    if arg is not None:
        return (pet for pet in pets if pet.name in arg)

    return []

If you want a list of items (e.g strings) but you don't want duplicates, you can use set[data_type] as the type hint.
So instead of above you would do:

@quickie.get("/multiple/pets")
async def get_multiple_by_name(arg: Annotated[set[str] | None, Query()] = None): # do this. you can provide a default list apart from None
    if arg is not None:
        return (pet for pet in pets if pet.name in arg)

    return []
Duplicate data will be converted to a set of unique items.


MORE QUERY METADATA
async def get_multiple_by_name(
        name_list: Annotated[
            list[str] | None,
            Query(
                alias="user-name", # this metadata will be the alias name of the query parameter used in the URL, but in our code we're referring to it using a different variable name
                title="Multiple search list", # give a title that will be used in the docs
                description="Searching for multiple pets using multiple names", # and a description too. will be used by OpenAPI docs
                deprecated=True, # mark as deprecated so that it shows clearly in the docs. clients are still using it, but in your books it is deprecated and will probably be phased out sometime
                include_in_schema=True # True to include schema in the OpenAPI docs, False to exclude
            )
        ] = None):

*Tip*
Preferably, always use Annotated when tweaking your parameters
E.g
Instead of this
    @app.get("/items/{item_id}")
    async def read_items(q: str, item_id: int = Path(title="The ID of the item to get")):
Use this:
    @app.get("/items/{item_id}")
    async def read_items(q: str, item_id: Annotated[int, Path(title="The ID of the item to get")]):


*** PATH PARAMETERS AND VALIDATIONS ***
Path parameters are the part of the URL that come before after the host name and before the query (?) parameters.
Validations and metadata for path parameters are done the same as above for query parameters, only that we use the Path function and not Query
    from fastapi import Path

Query, Path, and other classes are subclasses of a common Param class. ALL of them SHARE THE SAME PARAMETERS for
additional validation and metadata you have seen.

Example path metadata:
    @app.get('/users/age/{age}')
    def get_users_by_age(age: Annotated[int, Path(description="Get users whose age is the one specified", ge=6, le=100)]):
'age' will be required to be an integer that is greater than 6 and less than or equal to 100. An error will be returned as response if this requirement
is not met. A description is also provided as metadata.



*** BODY ***
MULTIPLE BODY PARAMETERS
Just declare multiple parameters as pydantic models inside your endpoint schema (function) and FastAPI will expect a nested JSON object with
keys as variable (parameter) names and values as pydantic models which are themselves JSON objects.

E.g
class Item(BaseModel):

class User(BaseModel):


@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
async def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item, user: User):
    results = {"item_id": item_id, "item": item, "user": user}
    return results

In this case, FastAPI will notice that there are more than one body parameters in the function (two parameters that are Pydantic models).
So, it will then use the parameter names (or aliases, if any) as keys (field names) in the body, and expect a nested body like:

{
    "item": {...},
    "user": {...}
}
You can have more deeply nested models. To nest, declare pydantic models as attributes of your pydantic models. Those pydantic models that are children
can have more children and you will have a nested situation. The client will have to send a JSON object that matches the schema tho'.


REQUIRING A NESTED JSON OBJECT EVEN FOR A SINGLE KEY-VALUE BODY PARAMETER
Use Body from FastAPI and specify metadata 'embed' as True

@quickie.post('/pets')
# async def add_pet(pet: Pet): # instead of this...
async def add_pet(pet: Annotated[Pet, Body(embed=True)]): # do this, set 'embed' in Body to be True
    pets.append(pet)

First one will require a json object like:
{
    "animal": "pony",
    "name": "tail",
    "gender": "female"
}

Second one will require such a nested json:
{
  "pet": {
    "animal": "pony",
    "name": "tail",
    "gender": "female"
  }
}

DECLARING A SINGLE PARAMETER AS A BODY ITEM
By default, single value parameters (primitives like str, int, float) are interpreted as query parameters. But sometimes, you usually want it
to be a request body instead.
In such a case, use Annotated, and Body from FastAPI as metadata like so:

    @app.post("/foobar")
    def foobar(choo: Annotated[str, Body()]):
Now choo will be the request body instead as query parameter.

Body also has all the same extra validation and metadata parameters as Query, Path and others.


VALIDATIONS FOR BODY FIELDS (Attributes of your pydantic models)
Use Field from pydantic
The same way you can declare additional validation and metadata in path operation function parameters with Query, Path and Body,
you can declare validation and metadata inside of Pydantic models using Pydantic's Field.
Note that Field is imported directly from pydantic, not from fastapi as are all the rest (Query, Path, Body, etc). Import is: from pydantic import Field
Field works the same way as Query, Path and Body, it has all the same parameters, etc.

Import Field and use it with your model attributes.
E.g:
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Price(BaseModel):
    price: float = Field(gt=100, description="We don't sell cars less than 100 bucks") # use this for metadata and validations inside your models
    currency: str
price will be a float that is greater than 100

class CarBuyerProfile(BaseModel):
    gender: Gender
    age: int = Field(le=30, description="Our buyers are not old")
age will be an integer less than or equal to 30


SPECIAL TYPES FOR VALIDATION
You can use special data types from pydantic to give you extra validation for your data.
E.g you might want a url or email address from the client and you want to make sure the data is correct and properly formatted

from pydantic import HttpUrl, EmailStr

class Foo(BaseModel):
    bar: HttpUrl # this will validate a url string and return an error if it is not
    baz: EmailStr # and this will be an email string. If it doesn't exist, add it using pip: pip install pydantic['email']


LIST IN TOP LEVEL
If the top level value of the JSON body you expect is a JSON array (a Python list), you can declare the type in the parameter of the function to be list[<type>],
the same as in Pydantic models:

@app.post("/images/multiple/")
async def create_multiple_images(images: list[Image]):
    return images


ALTERNATIVE TO PYDANTIC MODELS
If you don't want to work with pydantic models for some reason, e.g if you're receiving keys that you don't already know, you can use dict
instead of pydantic models.
E.g:
@app.post("/foobar")
def foobar(choo: dict[str, int]):
    return choo


GETTING COOKIES FROM THE REQUEST
Use Annotated and Cookie

from fastapi import Cookie

@app.get("/items")
async def read_items(ads_id: Annotated[str | None, Cookie()] = None): # this will read the cookie using the key 'ads_id' from the request
    return {"ads_id": ads_id}

HTTP request:
    GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/items
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/json
    Cookie: user-name=uzr; pwd=1234; ads_id=82efad4

    "foo bar"



GETTING HEADERS FROM THE REQUEST (Super-Easy)
Use Annotated and Header

Headers usually have hyphens instead of underscore and FastAPI automatically does the conversion from hyphen to python-legal underscores for us.

@app.get('/headers')
def get_headers(
        user_agent: Annotated[str | None, Header()] = None,     # looks for header with key 'user_agent' in the request headers
        authority: Annotated[str | None, Header()] = None,
        path: Annotated[str | None, Header()] = None,
        scheme: Annotated[str | None, Header()] = None,
        accept: Annotated[Any | None, Header()] = None,
        accept_encoding: Annotated[Any | None, Header()] = None,
        cookie: Annotated[Any | None, Header()] = None
    ):
    return {
        "agent": user_agent,
        "authority": authority,
        "path": path,
        "scheme": scheme,
        "accept": accept,
        "encoding": accept_encoding,
        "cookie": cookie
    }

GETTING LIST OF VALUES FROM A HEADER (duplicate headers)
    @app.get('/cookies')
    def get_cookies(api_token: Annotated[list[str], Header()]):
        return {
            "tokens": api_token
        }

    Get request:
        GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/cookies
        Accept: application/json
        Content-Type: application/json
        Api-Token: abc123
        Api-Token: def456
        Api-Token: ghi789   # these duplicate headers will be interpreted as a list in the above handler


RESPONSE MODEL
You can declare the type used for the response by annotating the path operation function return type.

There are some cases where you need or want to return some data that is not exactly what the type declares. For example, you could want to return a
dictionary or a database object, but declare it as a Pydantic model. This way the Pydantic model would do all the data documentation, validation, etc.
for the object that you returned (e.g. a dictionary or database object).
If you added the return type annotation, tools and editors would complain with a (correct) error telling you that your function is returning a type
(e.g. a dict) that is different from what you declared (e.g. a Pydantic model).

In those cases, you can use the path operation decorator parameter 'response_model' instead of the return type. You can use response_model in any path operation (get, put, post, delete etc)

@app.get("/items/", response_model=list[Item])
async def read_items() -> Any:
    return [    # now we're returning a list of dictionaries instead of a list of --Item-- objects, but we should be good since we set the
                # response_model to be list[Item] and so any dicts that match the schema for Item are legal
        {"name": "Portal Gun", "price": 42.0},
        {"name": "Plumbus", "price": 32.0},
    ]

response_model PRIORITY
If you declare both a return type and a response_model, the response_model will take priority and be used by FastAPI.
This way you can add correct type annotations to your functions even when you are returning a type different than the
response model, to be used by the editor and tools like mypy. And still you can have FastAPI do the data validation,
documentation, etc. using the response_model.

You can also use response_model=None to disable creating a response model for that path operation, you might need to do
it if you are adding type annotations for things that are not valid Pydantic fields.



*** response_model with Union of two types ***
You can declare a response to be the Union of two types, that means, that the response would be any of the two.
Because we are passing it as a value to an argument instead of putting it in a type annotation, we have to use Union even in Python 3.10+
If we use this method (example):
    response_model=PlaneItem | CarItem
we would get an error, because Python would try to perform an invalid operation between PlaneItem and CarItem instead of interpreting that as a type annotation..

Correct way to do it:
from typing import Union

class BaseItem(BaseModel):
    description: str
    type: str

class CarItem(BaseItem):
    type = "car"

class PlaneItem(BaseItem):
    type = "plane"
    size: int

items = {
    "item1": {"description": "All my friends drive a low rider", "type": "car"},
    "item2": {
        "description": "Music is my aeroplane, it's my aeroplane",
        "type": "plane",
        "size": 5,
    },
}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}", response_model=Union[PlaneItem, CarItem])  # not response_model=PlaneItem | CarItem
async def read_item(item_id: str):
    return items[item_id]



FILTERING DATA USING response_model
class BaseUser(BaseModel):
    id: int | None = None
    username: str
    email: str
    full_name: str | None = None
    password: str

Scenario, you are adding in a new user to your database but in the response, you only want to return the new user's created account id.

OPTION 1:
    Use response_model_include in the path spec.

    @app.post("/user/", response_model_include={'id'}) # response_model_include is a set of the keys in the pydantic model that you want included in the response
    async def create_user(user: BaseUser) -> BaseUser:
        user.id = time.time()
        return user

OPTION 2:
    You can also exclude certain info using response_model_exclude
    @app.post("/user/", response_model_exclude={'password', 'email'}) # exclude the password from the response. response_model_exclude is a set of keys
    async def create_user(user: BaseUser) -> BaseUser:
        user.id = time.time()
        return user

OPTION 3:
    Another option is to use another model that is a mirror copy of the original pydantic model but only contains the fields that you want to return
    in the response; and then pass in that model as an argument to 'response_model' in the decorator function of your path operation function.

    class BaseUserMinified(BaseModel): # this model contains the fields except id and password
        username: str
        email: str
        full_name: str | None = None

        @app.post("/user/", response_model=BaseUserMinified) # use the second model as the response model so that it returns only the desired fields in response
        async def create_user(user: BaseUser) -> BaseUser:
            user.id = time.time()
            return user

OPTION 4:
    Use inheritance.
    Create the basis pydantic model with the fields that you need in the output, and then another model that inherits from that basis
    model (not BaseModel from pydantic) and includes other fields that you want to filter out of the output

    class BaseUser(BaseModel):
        username: str
        email: str

    class UserExtended(BaseUser):
        id: int | None = None
        full_name: str | None = None
        password: str

    @app.post("/user/")
    async def create_user(user: UserExtended) -> BaseUser: # type in args and return type are different, but instances of UserExtended are also instances of BaseUser,
                                                           # so we can return instance of UserExtended where BaseUser is defined as return type.
                                                           # In this case, BaseUser will be used as the response model and will effectively filter out fields not defined
                                                           # inside it from the output.
        user.id = time.time()
        return user     # this is an instance of UserExtended, but the output will contain only the fields defined in BaseUser
                        # because BaseUser is used as the return type.

OPTION 5:
If you want to filter out default values (set by you the programmer in the model declaration) from your pydantic model in the response:
    Use 'response_model_exclude_unset' to return only the values explicitly set. It is a boolean parameter


DEALING WITH RESPONSES

When you create a FastAPI path operation you can normally return any data from it: a dict, a list, a Pydantic model, a database model, etc.
By default, FastAPI would automatically convert that return value to JSON using the jsonable_encoder explained in JSON Compatible Encoder.
Then, behind the scenes, it would put that JSON-compatible data (e.g. a dict) inside of a JSONResponse that would be used to send the response to the client.
But, you can return a JSONResponse (a subclass of Response) directly from your path operations.
It might be useful, for example, to return custom headers or cookies with the response, or do further customization to the response other than just returning data.
You might also want to do something like redirect the user to another url and so you'll need the more niche RedirectResponse

        from fastapi import FastAPI, Response
        from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse, RedirectResponse

        @app.get("/portal")
        async def get_portal(teleport: bool = False) -> Response:
            if teleport:
                return RedirectResponse(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ")
            return JSONResponse(content={"message": "Here's your interdimensional portal."})


        If you're returning a pydantic model, you can also encode your model to json using jsonable_encoder from fastapi.encoders
        jsonable_encoder returns the appropriate transformed object: it can a list or dict for instance.

        from fastapi.encoders import jsonable_encoder

        @app.get('/person', response_model=Person)
        def get_person(gender: Gender | None = None):
            p = Person(dob=date.today(), gender=gender)
            return JSONResponse(headers = {...headers here...}, content=jsonable_encoder(p), status_code=200)

You might also want to use a different content type in your response other than json, e.g XML. Use the 'media_type' parameter in your response

        @app.get("/legacy/")
        def get_legacy_data():
            data = """<?xml version="1.0"?>
            <shampoo>
            <Header>
                Apply shampoo here.
            </Header>
            <Body>
                You'll have to use soap here.
            </Body>
            </shampoo>
            """
            return Response(content=data, media_type="application/xml")



DEFINING STATUS CODES FOR YOUR RESPONSES
You can either do it at the decorator level or in the function level when you're returning your response

1. Decorator level
    from fastapi import status

    @app.get("/foo", status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
    async def foo():
        return "created"

    Or you can use the status code integer without importing from status
    @app.get("/foo", status_code=201)
    async def foo():
        return "created"

2. Function level (returning response)
    from fastapi import Response

    @app.get("/foo")
    async def foo():
        return Response(content="created", status_code=201, media_type='text')

    Alternative to above:
    @app.get("/foo")
    async def foo(response: Response):
        response.status_code = 201 # in this case you don't have to return the response, just set the status code and leave it
        return "created"


READING FORM DATA FROM HTML
1. First, install python-multipart:
    pip install python-multipart
2. Create your HTML form:
    <form action="/login" method="post">
    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>

    <br>

    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>

    <br>

    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
3. Form will send request to your server when user submits form.
4. OK, here's what I wrote to get the log-in page and the server function to handle in:
    @app.get('/team/log-in')
    def get_login_page():
        with open('page.html', 'r') as page:
            return Response(page.read(), media_type='text/html')


    @app.post('/login')
    def log_in(username: Annotated[str, Form()], password: Annotated[str, Form()]):
        print("password: ", password)
        response = f"""
            <html>
            Welcome {username}!
            <br>
            You logged in successfully. <br>
            Here's your secret key: {hash(password)}
        </html>
        """

        return Response(content=response, media_type='text/html')


THROWING AN ERROR
Scenarios: invalid request, data not found, insufficient security clearance etc
Workaround: raise HTTPException (from fastapi)

from fastapi import HTTPException

@app.get("/pho0pho")
async def not_found():
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=404 # status code can be anything depending on the kind of error you're throwing,
        detail="not existing bud" # this will be the content displayed to the user
        headers={'foo': 'bar'}      # any headers you want to add to the error. headers is a dictionary
    )

YOU CAN THROW A CUSTOM ERROR WITH CUSTOM RESPONSE FOR A STATUS CODE THAT OVERRIDES FastAPI's DEFAULT RESPONSE FOR THAT
STATUS CODE
Steps:
1. Create a custom exception
    class NFException(Exception): # custom not found exception

        def __init__(self, search_term):
            self.search_term = search_term

2. Create a custom exception handler for that specific exception for when it's raised.
Use the @app.exception_handler() decorator and pass in your exception class as argument.
FastAPI will invoke this handler automatically when you raise the exception elsewhere in your code.
When FastAPI invokes your handler function, it passes in two positional arguments:
    - A Request (fastapi.Request) object - the request from the client
        The Request object various information about the client, e.g host name, port, headers, cookies etc
    - The instance of your custom exception that was raised (which contains its data, ofc)
You can use those arguments above in your custom Response that you return to the client like below, and even
include a status code and headers in your response.

    @app.exception_handler(NFException)
    def search(request: Request, exc: NFException):
        content = """<html lang="en">
            <head>
                <meta charset="UTF-8">
                <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
                <title>404 Not Found</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <div class="container">
                    <h1>404 Not Found</h1>
                    <p>Sorry, no search results matching '{exc.search_term}' were found.</p>
                    <p><a href="/team/log-in">Go back to the home page</a></p>
                </div>
            </body>
            </html>"""
        return Response(content, media_type='text/html', status_code=404)

3. Raise the exception anywhere in your code to invoke your custom handler for that exception
    @app.get('/search')
    def search(query: str):
        raise NFException(query)



PATH OPERATION CONFIGS
Docstring
If you provide a docstring in any of your path operation functions, FastAPI will use that as a description in the OpenAPI documentations.

Tags
If you want to group your path operations with tags (at least in the OpenAPI docs - visually), add the parameter 'tags' to your
decorator declaration and pass in a list[str] of tags as argument
    @app.get('/team/log-in', tags=['team']) # add tags
    def get_login_page():
        pass

    or use Enum for consistency

    class Tags(Enum):
        team = 'team'
        marketing = 'marketing'

    @app.get('/team/log-in', tags=[Tags.team]) # add tags
    def get_login_page():
        pass
Other things you can add are 'summary', 'description' (can provide docstring in place of description), 'deprecated' (True or False) etc




JSON COMPATIBLE ENCODER
There are some cases where you might need to convert a data type (like a Pydantic model) to something compatible with JSON (like a dict, list, etc).
For example, if you need to store it in a database.
For that, FastAPI provides a jsonable_encoder() function.

from fastapi.encoders import jsonable_encoder
import json

@app.post('/person')
def add_person(person: Person): # Person is a pydantic model
    json_encodable_data = jsonable_encoder(person)
    # Now you can convert it to a json string using json.dumps
    print(json.dumps(json_encodable_data))
    return person
