*** DEPENDENCIES ***

    DEPENDENCY INJECTION
"Dependency Injection" means, in programming, that there is a way for your code (in this case, your path operation functions)
to declare things that it requires to work and use: "dependencies".
And then, that system (in this case FastAPI) will take care of doing whatever is needed to provide your code with those needed dependencies ("inject" the dependencies).

This is very useful when you need to:

- Have shared logic (the same code logic again and again).
- Share database connections.
- Enforce security, authentication, role requirements, etc.

And many other things...while minimizing code repetition

Other intuitive explanation
    With the Dependency Injection system, you can also tell FastAPI that your path operation function also "depends" on
    something else that should be executed before your path operation function, and FastAPI will take care of executing it
    and "injecting" the results.

Other common terms for this same idea of "dependency injection" are:
    - resources
    - providers
    - services
    - injectables
    - components


Depends (from fastapi) is the center of gravity of the dependency injection system
    from fastapi import Depends

Depends is a function that takes in a callable as the main parameter (this is what you'll inject) - it takes in another parameter too('use_cache').

The KEY FACTOR is that a dependency should be a "callable".

    A "callable" in Python is anything that Python can "call" like a function.

    So, if you have an object something (that might not be a function) and you can "call" it (execute it) like:

    something()
    or
    something(some_argument, some_keyword_argument="foo")

    then it is a "callable".

A python function, or class, etc are all callables.

Now that callable will execute some code for you and provide it back so that you can use it.
Using this dependency injection model, you can share code and reduce duplication since you don't have to define and implement everything
inside your path operation functions.

Example:
    from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends

    def multiples(number: int = ..., upper_bound: int | None = None) -> list:   # this is the callable that we will inject
        return [number * i for i in range(1, upper_bound + 1 if upper_bound else 21)]


    app = FastAPI()


    @app.get('/{number}')
    def get_multiples(muls: Annotated[list, Depends(multiples)]): # inject the callable into Depends without the parentheses ()

        return {
            "multiples": muls   # it executes the code for us and returns for us the result
        }

In this case, the callable is just a function that can take all the same parameters that a path operation function can take.
Notice, the data type specified in the path operation function parameters (inside Annotated) is not actually any of the data types the path operation
actually expects to receive from the client. It has nothing to do without the data from the client, but it has everything to do with
the data we expect to be returned and 'injected' from the execution of the dependency. In this case, the dependency 'multiples' will return (inject) a list,
and so we pass in 'list' as the type to the Annotated. The type specified inside the Annotated is what is expected to be returned from the function
We *depend* on a list to be returned from the function, and FastAPI *injects* it for us in our path operation function.


Although you use Depends in the parameters of your function the same way you use Body, Query, etc, Depends works a bit differently.
You only give Depends a single parameter.
This parameter must be something like a function.
You don't call it directly (don't add the parenthesis at the end), you just pass it as a parameter to Depends().
Other "things", apart from functions (e.g classes), can be used as dependencies.

Whenever a new request arrives, FastAPI will take care of:
    - Calling your dependency ("dependable") function with the correct parameters.
    - Get the result from your function.
    - Assign that result to the parameter in your path operation function.

To get rid of duplication in the above example, if we're gonna use the dependency in multiple places, we do this:

    Multiplier = Annotated[list, Depends(multiples)]  # give the dependency an alias
    # This is just standard Python, it's called a "type alias",

    app = FastAPI()

    @app.get('/{number}')
    def get_multiples(muls: Multiplier):    # now use the alias so that you don't have to rewrite the whole Annotated[...] everywhere you use the dependency

        return {
            "multiples": muls
        }


    @app.get('/investment_returns/{investor}')
    async def invest_returns(investor: str, returns: Multiplier):   # now use the alias so that you don't have to rewrite the whole Annotated[...] everywhere you use the dependency
        return {
            "investor": investor,
            "investment_returns": returns
        }

All these dependencies, while declaring their requirements, also add parameters, validations, etc. to your path operations.

FastAPI will take care of adding it all to the OpenAPI schema, so that it is shown in the interactive documentation systems.
Other common terms for the same idea of "dependency injection" are:
    - resources
    - providers (like Provider in flutter)
    - services
    - injectables
    - components


CLASSES AS DEPENDENCIES
Since classes are callable, you can use them instead of functions when appropriate to achieve the same effect. Classes, though, give you extra benefits like better editor support
and code completion. Also, it would be more elegant to organize your code in models (classes) from which you can reference attributes in an OOP way.

If you pass a "callable" as a dependency in FastAPI, it will analyze the parameters for that "callable", and process them
in the same way as the parameters for a path operation function. Including sub-dependencies.
That also applies to callables with no parameters at all. The same as it would be for path operation functions with no parameters.

class Multiplier:

    num: int
    multiples: list[int]

    def __init__(self, num: int | None = None, topline: int = 20): # initializing the Multiplier class returns an instance of it.
        self.num = num if num else random.randrange(1, 10000)
        self.multiples = [self.num * i for i in range(1, topline + 1)]


@app.get('/multiples/{number}')
def get_multiples(muls: Annotated[Multiplier, Depends(Multiplier)]): # an instance of Multiplier will be injected into 'muls'

    return {
        "multiples": muls.multiples
    }

A more shorthand and less code-repetitive way of use Annotated and Depends so that we don't have to repeat the class name twice is just to omit
the dependency from Depends when calling it. Just call it with empty parentheses like in the below example. It will still achieve the same effect
editor- and computation-wise as if you had explicitly passed the dependency in. The benefit you get is elegance and less duplication.

@app.get('/investment_returns/{investor}')
async def invest_returns(investor: str, multiplier: Annotated[Multiplier, Depends()]):
    return {
        "investor": investor,
        "investment_returns": multiplier
    }


USING THE SAME DEPENDENCY MULTIPLE TIMES
If one of your dependencies is declared multiple times for the same path operation, for example, multiple dependencies have
a common sub-dependency, FastAPI will know to call that sub-dependency only once per request.
And it will save the returned value in a "cache" and pass it to all the "dependants" that need it in that specific request,
instead of calling the dependency multiple times for the same request.
In an advanced scenario where you know you need the dependency to be called at every step (possibly multiple times) in
the same request instead of using the "cached" value, you can set the parameter use_cache=False when using Depends:

async def needy_dependency(fresh_value: Annotated[str, Depends(get_value, use_cache=False)]):
    return {"fresh_value": fresh_value}



DEPENDENCIES IN PATH OPERATION DECORATORS

In some cases you don't really need the return value of a dependency inside your path operation function. Or the dependency doesn't return a value.
But you still need it to be executed/solved.
For those cases, instead of declaring a path operation function parameter with Depends, you can add a list of dependencies
to the path operation decorator. Each path operation decorator receives an optional argument called 'dependencies'
These dependencies will be executed/solved the same way normal dependencies. But their value (if they return any) won't be
passed to your path operation function.

Example: verifying a request using a security key in the headers

    from fastapi import Depends

    async def verify_security_key(x_secret_key: Annotated[str | None, Header()] = None):    # check the headers for a valid security key before executing path operation
        if x_secret_key is None:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail='No password provided')
        if x_secret_key != 'zdash9na9na':
            raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail='Invalid password')


    @app.get('/secret_resource', dependencies=[Depends(verify_security_key)])   # pass the dependency to the list 'dependencies' in the decorator
    async def fetch_secret_resource():
        return "here's the secret. shhh don't tell anyone"


In the above example, the code inside the function only runs after the dependency has finished executing. If the dependency completes
and the password doesn't exist or is invalid, a HttpException is raised and the code inside the path operation function is not executed. It only
executes and returns the secret resource if the password is valid.

The code in the dependency is always ran before the actual function gets executed.


GLOBAL DEPENDENCIES
You can supply global dependencies that will be applied to every request by passing them in to your FastAPI instance when you initialize it.

In for example, the secret key scenario described above, if you want every request (and so every path operation) to have a valid secret key,
passing in the verify_security_key dependency to our FastAPI instance will ensure every request passes through the security key verification
before any of the path operation functions is executed. This is a very efficient and elegant way of ensuring consistency and reducing code duplication
in our codebase.
Doing this:
    async def verify_security_key(x_secret_key: Annotated[str | None, Header()] = None):
        if x_secret_key is None:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail='No password provided')
        if x_secret_key != 'zdash9na9na':
            raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail='Invalid password')

    app = FastAPI(dependencies=[Depends(verify_security_key)])  # add the dependency in the 'dependencies' list of our FastAPI instance

will ensure that all requests coming from the clients have the 'X-Secret-Key' header and that it is a valid key. All requests without
a valid key in the header will fail with a 403 error.


DEPENDENCIES WITH yield

FastAPI supports dependencies that do some extra steps after finishing.
To do this, use yield instead of return, and write the extra steps (code) after.
** Make sure to use yield one single time. **

ONLY the code prior to and including the yield statement is executed before creating a response:
    async def get_db():
        db = DBSession()
        try:
            yield db
        finally:
            db.close()
The yielded value is what is injected into path operations and other dependencies.

A Dependency with yield and try
def parse_login_page():
    try:
        with open('page.html', 'r') as page:
            yield page.read()   # yield the data that you want to be injected into the dependant
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print("Error occurred holmes: ", e)
        raise NFException("no page found")
    except SecException:
        print("no clearance bud")
    finally:
        print("response sent to client")

@app.get('/team/log-in', tags=['team'])
def get_login_page(content: Annotated[str, Depends(parse_login_page)]): # has parse_login_page as a dependency
    if not authorized:
        raise SecException("no clearance")
    return Response(content, media_type='text/html')

The code following the yield statement is executed AFTER the response has been delivered.

Any exceptions thrown within the dependency, and even its dependants (no matter how distant), can be caught using try except
so that you can process the errors that made the request to fail. Makes it easy to catch errors and handle them as desired.
Code in the finally block will be executed whether or not there was an exception.



CROSS-ORIGIN RESOURCE SHARING (CORS)
An origin is the combination of protocol (http, https), domain (myapp.com, localhost, localhost.tiangolo.com), and port (80, 443, 8080).

So, all these are different origins:
    http://localhost
    https://localhost
    http://localhost:8080
Even if they are all in localhost, they use different protocols or ports, so, they are different "origins".

The backend has to have a list of 'allowed origins' from which clients use to reference the backend while sending requests.
If a client uses an origin that isn't allowed, the request will fail.

To specify allowed origins in FastAPI, you use the CORSMiddleware middleware and add it to your FastAPI instance.

from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

allowed_origins = [
    'http://localhost:7000'     # you can use '*' if you want all origins to be allowed
]

app = FastAPI(dependencies=[Depends(verify_security_key)])
app.add_middleware( # use the add_middleware() function to add the middleware
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=allowed_origins
)

It's also possible to declare the list as "*" (a "wildcard") to say that all are allowed.
But that will only allow certain types of communication, excluding everything that involves credentials: Cookies, Authorization headers
like those used with Bearer Tokens, etc. So, for everything to work correctly, it's better to specify explicitly the allowed origins.


The default parameters used by the CORSMiddleware implementation are restrictive by default, so you'll need to explicitly
enable particular origins, methods, or headers, in order for browsers to be permitted to use them in a Cross-Domain context.

Example CORS settings:

    app.add_middleware(
        CORSMiddleware,
        allow_origins=origins,
        allow_credentials=True,
        allow_methods=["*"],
        allow_headers=["*"],
    )

BACKGROUND TASKS

You can schedule background tasks that are not very pertinent to the completion of a request to be done after the response has been sent
back to the client. For example, if a user signed up and you want to send them a verification email afterwards, you don't have to send
the email before the request completes because it could take time hence delaying the response and affecting user experience.

If you add a task to the background tasks queue, it will be scheduled by FastAPI and executed after the response has been sent
to the client. The response will just be sent right away without waiting for the task to finish.

How to: Use BackgroundTasks from fastapi

    from fastapi import BackgroundTasks
    import time

    async def verify_user(user: User):      # example of a task, in this case simulation of sending an email
        print(f"Sending verification email to {user.user_name}'s email: {user.email}")
        time.sleep(12)  # simulate a delay
        print("Verified user:", user)


    @router.post('/', response_model_include={'id'})
    def add_user(user: User, jobs: BackgroundTasks) -> User:    # include BackgroundTasks as a parameter in your path operation function
        user.id = round(time.time())                            # and FastAPI will take care of it
        user_db[user.id] = user

        jobs.add_task(verify_user, user)    # use the add_task function of BackgroundTasks to add a callable (function in this case)
                                            # that will be executed. the arguments that follow are parameters that are to be passed
                                            # to the callable while calling it.
        return user
